            Rolling back to 2017, where we had ICT classes in my old school, we used to learn about block coding on the website "hourofcode.com", I used to be good at it and was very intrested in it,
            and that was the beginning of my journy, though i wasnt ready i didnt have a good device to work on 
            </h3>-->
            <h3>
                As a young 8 Y/O that was intrested in video games, like Uncharted 4 or Horizon, I want to know how things like these games worked, so i watched some video tutorials but it required a computer which I didnt have so i checked my app store on my ipad for some Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to code on
                found some IDEs for python so i just went for python, allthough I was learning by copying and pasting I had so much fun.
            </h3>
            <h1>So I started my journy which will never end.</h3>
